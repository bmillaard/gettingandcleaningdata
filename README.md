Getting and cleaning data course project
This is the course project for Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera. Code is written in R in file. Source file is run_analysis.R. 

# Project
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

# Study 
The experiments has been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

# Project Summary
## This R script does the following things:

Loads the datasets

Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset

assigns column names

Merges the datasets

Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.

Create a second, independent tidy set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Write the data set to the tidy_data.txt file.
